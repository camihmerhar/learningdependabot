2. In the new tab, follow the prompts to create a new repository.
   - For owner, choose your personal account or an organization to host the repository.
   - We recommend creating a public repositoryâ€”private repositories will [use Actions minutes](https://docs.github.com/en/billing/managing-billing-for-github-actions/about-billing-for-github-actions).

_Welcome to "Securing your repositories supply chain"! :wave:_

**What is Securing your repositories supply chain**: GitHub helps you secure your supply chain, from understanding the dependencies in your environment, to knowing about vulnerabilities in those dependencies, and patching them.

* To read more about Secuirng your repositories supply chain: [Secuirng your repositories supply chain](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-supply-chain-security)
   
**What is a Dependency Graph**: The dependency graph is a summary of the manifest and lock files stored in a repository and any dependencies that are submitted for the repository using the Dependency submission API (beta). For each repository, it shows:

* Dependencies, the ecosystems and packages it depends on
* Dependents, the repositories and packages that depend on it
* To ready more about Dependency graph: [Dependency graph](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/about-the-dependency-graph)

### :keyboard: Activity: Verify Dependency graph enabled

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
2. Navigate to the `Settings` tab.
3. Click on `Code security and analysis`.   
4. Verify/enable Dependency graph. If the repo is private you will enable it here. If the repo is public it will be enabled by default.
5. Move on to the next activity.

### :keyboard: Activity: View dependencies

1. Navigate to the `Insights` tab.
2. Click on `Dependency` graph.
3. Review all the dependecies on the `Dependencies` hub.
4. Learn how to explore dependencies: [Explore dependecies](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/understanding-your-software-supply-chain/exploring-the-dependencies-of-a-repository)
5. Move on to the next activity.

### :keyboard: Activity: Add and view dependency

1. Navigate to the `Code` tab.
2. Navigate to the `code/src/AttendeeSite` folder
3. Add the following content to the `package-lock.json` file after the third to last `}`
   ```
   ,
    "follow-redirects": {
      "version": "1.14.1",
      "resolved": "https://registry.npmjs.org/follow-redirects/-/follow-redirects-1.14.1.tgz",
      "integrity": "sha512-HWqDgT7ZEkqRzBvc2s64vSZ/hfOceEol3ac/7tKwzuvEyWx3/4UegXh5oBOIotkGsObyk3xznnSRVADBgWSQVg=="
    }
   ```
4. Navigate to the `Insights` tab.
5. Click on `Dependency` graph.
6. Review all new dependecies on the `Dependencies` hub.
7. Search for `follow-redirects` and review the dependancy.
8. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.

<summary><h2>Step 2: Enable and view Dependabot alerts</h2></summary>

_Nice work! :tada: You added and viewed a dependency with `Dependency graph`!_

Next, we need to enable and view dependabot alerts.

**What are Dependabot alerts**: Dependabot alerts tell you that your code depends on a package that is insecure. Dependabot alerts references The GitHub Advisory Database that contains a list of known security vulnerabilities and malware, grouped in two categories: GitHub-reviewed advisories and unreviewed advisories.

* About Dependabot alerts: [Dependabot alerts](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/about-dependabot-alerts)
* About GitHub Advisory Database: [GitHub Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-alerts/browsing-security-advisories-in-the-github-advisory-database)
 
### :keyboard: Activity: View security advisories in the GitHub Advisory Database

1. Open a new browser tab.
2. Navigate to the [GitHub Advisory Database](https://github.com/advisories).
3. Type or paste `follow-redirects` into the search box.
4. Click on any of the advisories that were found.
5. Note the packages, impact, patches, workaround and referennces for the advisory.
6. Move on to the next activity.

 ### :keyboard: Activity: Enable Dependabot alerts

1. Open a new browser tab, and work on the steps in your second tab while you read the instructions in this tab.
2. Navigate to the `Settings` tab.
3. Click on `Code security and analysis`.  
4. Click `Enable` Dependabot alerts.
5. Wait about 60 seconds then click on the `Security` tab at the top of the repository.
6. Verify there are 4 `Dependabot` alerts under the `Vulnerability alerts` section.
7. Revew each alert.
8. Move on to the next activity.
 
 ### :keyboard: Activity: Create a Pull Request based on a Dependabot alert

1. Click on `Prototype Pollution in minimist` alert under the `Dependabot alerts` section.
2. View the alert.
3. Click `Create Dependabot security update` button. The will create a pull request for the fix.
4. Wait until the pull request is created. This could take ~2 minutes.
5. Click on `Review security update` button. The pull request will be displayed.
6. View the pull request. View the `Files changed` tab to review the update.
7. Navigate back to the `Conversation` tab.
8. Click on `Merge pull request` button.
9. Click `confirm merge` button.
10. Wait about 20 seconds then refresh this page for the next step.
